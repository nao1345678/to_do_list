# To do list 

## Description 
This to-do list is the way I got introduced to Next JS, and closer to CSS and TypeScript.
It hopefully will continuously get updated, so I can keep adding small options to it.

## How is it organised ? 

- *The main program*'s path is ```\src\app```
- *The pictures* used are into ```\public```
- *The component* is located in ```\src\components```
- *The file* ```.eslintrc.json``` is my code formatter

## How does it work ? 
It's easy ! You just have to have Next JS installed. Here's the link of the official Next JS documentation.
Then, to run the website, you just have to run ```npm run dev``` and the app should be running on ```localhost:3000```.
